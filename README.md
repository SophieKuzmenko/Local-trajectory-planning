# Local trajectory planning with static obstacle avoidance
University project
Implementation of a local trajectory planning algorithm with static obstacles avoidance described in [1] <br>
The breakdown of the algorithm:
1. Generating a set of candidate paths
2. Eliminating non-executable candidate paths ( due to steering limitations or potential collisions with the obstacles)
3. Choosing the most optimal path
